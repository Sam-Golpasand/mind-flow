#### **Description:** 
My self-help website provides tools to help you improve yourself. On the homepage, you will find a quotes box that displays a new inspiring quote each time you refresh the page. The meditations tab contains two audio files of guided meditations, one twenty minutes long and one ten minutes long. The journals tab is where you can create your own journal to write about your day or your emotions.

#### **Development:**
I built this website from the ground up, taking inspiration from the PSET 9 finance website for the login and layout. I also borrowed the helpers.py file. In users.db, I created two tables: one for user information and one for user journals. I linked the two tables using the user ID. The design of the page is minimal, with no unnecessary text or sections. This is to ensure that the page is not distracting, but still provides the necessary tools for self-improvement. 

#### **Thought's on individual Files:**
*Apology.html:*
This is also borrowed from PSET 9. I originally planned to create a red alert at the top of the page for each error, but I couldn't get it to work. I decided to prioritize finishing the project over making it perfect.

*Meditation.html:*
I had some difficulty designing this page. I still think it's a bit empty, and I could have added more or implemented the meditation feature differently. However, I prefer simplicity and minimalism to having too many meditations or features on the page.

*index.html:*
I am quite pleased with the way the homepage turned out. The quote section is particularly well-done. I had originally planned to implement an API that would display the weather in your location, but after a couple of hours, I decided against it. It would have been ugly and would have ruined the aesthetic of the page.

#### **Final Words:**
 I began CS50 over a year ago. I was busy with school, and I procrastinated a lot, so I didn't finish the project until now. But as I write these final words, I am filled with joy to say that... **I have finally completed CS50.**
